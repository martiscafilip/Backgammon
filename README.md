&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiplayer backgammon can be played by 2 players in a network. They will be connected to a server that will facilitate communication between them.
This server will receive the moves made by each player and will send them to the other player to synchronize the tables.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each player will wait his turn until the other player makes all his moves.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a player takes his pieces off the board he will be called the winner.
